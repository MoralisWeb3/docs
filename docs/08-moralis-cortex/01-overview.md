# Moralis Cortex

**AI-Powered Web3 Intelligence. Instantly.**

Moralis Cortex is your gateway to real-time, AI-driven insights from blockchain data. Ask natural language questions. Get structured, explainable answers. Use it via our hosted API or run the Cortex MCP Server in your own infrastructure.

## What is Moralis Cortex?

Moralis Cortex is an AI-native data layer for Web3, built on top of the Moralis Model Context Protocol (MCP). It connects blockchain data with large language models like GPT-4 or Claude - enabling you to query on-chain activity using plain English or structured prompts.

Whether you're building dashboards, bots, reports, or intelligent assistants, Cortex gives you the power of AI - grounded in real blockchain data.

## Choose How To Use It

### 🌐 Cortex API (Hosted)

Use our hosted API to ask blockchain questions and get real-time insights - no setup required.

- **POST /v1/cortex/chat** - simple, secure REST endpoint
- Powered by enterprise-grade LLMs and Moralis infrastructure
- Returns summaries and structured data
- Supports chat history (chatId) for multi-turn conversations
- Optional streaming data - get live responses

**✅ Best for:**

- Startups, growth teams, and AI tooling
- Dashboards, chat agents, or in-product insights
- Teams who want fast access without infra overhead

### 🧩 MCP Server (Self-Hosted)

Deploy the MCP server in your own environment for full control and customization.

- Distributed via NPM
- Plug in your own LLM credentials (OpenAI, Claude, open-source)
- Customize grounding logic, data access, and plugins
- Run entirely inside your infra for privacy and compliance

**✅ Best for:**

- Enterprises with security/compliance requirements
- Developers building deeply integrated AI apps
- Teams wanting full control over data and model behavior

## Why Use Cortex?

- **🔍 Ask anything** about on-chain behavior - wallet activity, dapp usage, token flows, etc.
- **🧠 LLM-powered**: Use GPT-4, Claude, or open-source models with full flexibility
- **📊 Grounded in Moralis data**: No hallucinations - only indexed, verified blockchain truth
- **⚙️ Integrate anywhere**: APIs, agents, dashboards, or local developer tooling
- **🔒 Built for production**: Secure, composable, and extensible
