# Use Cases & Examples

Discover practical applications and real-world examples of building with Moralis Cortex for AI-powered Web3 intelligence.

## Analytics & Insights

### Portfolio Dashboard

Build user-friendly interfaces that explain crypto holdings in plain language.

**Example Query:** _"Analyze my portfolio diversity across Ethereum and Base, and suggest improvements"_

**Best Integration:** [Cortex API](/cortex/api) for web apps, [Cursor](/cortex/integrations/cursor) for development

### Market Intelligence Platform

Create sophisticated analysis tools that explain complex on-chain patterns.

**Example Query:** _"Show me whale movements for PEPE in the last 24 hours and their market impact"_

**Best Integration:** [ChatGPT API](/cortex/integrations/chatgpt-api) or [Claude API](/cortex/integrations/claude-api) for scalable applications

## AI Agents & Bots

### Trading Assistant

Build AI-powered trading assistants that understand market conditions and wallet behavior.

**Example Query:** _"Should I buy TOSHI based on current holder trends and whale activity?"_

**Best Integration:** [MCP Server](/cortex/mcp-server) for custom control, [Windsurf](/cortex/integrations/windsurf) for development

### Customer Support Bot

Create chatbots that can answer user questions about their wallets and transactions.

**Example Query:** _"Why didn't my transaction go through and what can I do about it?"_

**Best Integration:** [Cortex API](/cortex/api) for easy deployment

## Developer Tools

### CLI Integration

Add blockchain intelligence to command-line tools for developers.

**Example Query:** _"Check if this contract address has any recent security issues"_

**Best Integration:** [MCP Server](/cortex/mcp-server) with stdio transport

### Testing & QA

Create tools for crypto researchers to quickly analyze tokens, wallets, and market trends.

**Example Query:** _"Verify that our token distribution matches the expected whale/retail ratio"_

**Best Integration:** [Claude Desktop](/cortex/integrations/claude-desktop) for development workflows

## DeFi Applications

### Risk Assessment

Add intelligence to DeFi apps to help users understand risks, yields, and opportunities.

**Example Query:** _"What are the risks of providing liquidity to this pool based on historical data?"_

**Best Integration:** [Cortex API](/cortex/api) for real-time web integration

### Yield Optimization

Build tools that explain complex DeFi strategies in simple terms.

**Example Query:** _"Find the best yield farming opportunities for my wallet size and risk tolerance"_

**Best Integration:** [ChatGPT API](/cortex/integrations/chatgpt-api) for advanced reasoning
