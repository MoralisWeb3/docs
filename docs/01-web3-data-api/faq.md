## What is Moralis V2?

Moralis v2 is an enterprise-grade Web3 API solution that provides cross-chain solutions for developers building dapps. Moralis v2 offers several features for different purposes:

- [EVM API](https://docs.moralis.io/docs/evm-api)

Fetching NFT, token, and other on-chain related data from multiple EVM chains.

- Auth API

Verifying signed message for authenticating EVM and Solana wallets to dapps.

- [Streams API](https://docs.moralis.io/docs/streams-api)

Streaming real-time blockchain events data into your backend via webhooks.

- [Solana API](https://docs.moralis.io/docs/solana-api)

Fetching NFT, token, and other on-chain related data from the Solana network.

## How Does Moralis V2 Differ to Moralis V1?

Moralis v2 is backend-focused, providing Web3 developers powerful Web3 APIs that can be added to any tech stack to build their dapps. If you are building with NodeJS, Python, or C#, we have SDKs available for you to integrate easily with Moralis' enterprise-grade Web3 APIs.

Moralis v1 is client-focused and provides full-stack prototyping solutions for Web3 developers to build dapps quickly. Our SDKs are client-oriented, comprising of:

- [Vanilla JS SDK](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/Moralis-JS-SDK/releases/tag/v0.0.184)
- [React Moralis SDK](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/react-moralis)
- [Unity SDK](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/unity-web3-game-kit)

It is important to note that Moralis v1 has been deprecated and many of the features are now no longer available. If you'd like to use Moralis v1 in your development, [self-host your Moralis server](https://docs.moralis.io/docs/self-hosted-moralis-server) as the server feature is going to be deprecated in the future.

## Is there a list of things to check before going live (production)?

Before going into Production (Live), we highly recommend our users to reach out to us a few weeks before, so that there is enough time for us to assess your project needs and have the right plans to ensure a smooth operation when their project is live.

Below is a checklist of things to consider before going live:

- Ensure you're familiar with the weightings of all your API calls (weightings)
- Ensure you've calculated your estimates by considering the number of chains you need to call
- To avoid rate limits, build a service for error handling and retrying failed requests
- Spread out your calls to avoid rate limiting
- Parallel calls using different from_block and to_block ranges can help improve request speeds
- Prepare your rate limit for production - How do I upgrade my plan? (Increase Rate Limits)
- Please email us at success@moralis.io to get a custom rate limit above the Pro and Business plan.

## Check your request usage

Your current request usage statistics can be found under "Account>Usage".

- Click on your email address at the bottom left corner and then on "Account".

- Click on "Usage" on the top tab

![](/img/content/ee7cadd-image.webp)

Once on this page, you will be able to see the following data:

1 - Total number of requests available per month for your chosen plan.  
2 - Number of requests allowed per second (known as "Rate Limit")  
3 - Number of Web3API requests for the specified period.  
4 - Both the number of requests combined

If after reviewing your usage statistics you feel that you need a higher rate limit than the Free & Pro plan provides you with, please let us know, and we can introduce you to higher rate limits as being Enterprise API plans.
