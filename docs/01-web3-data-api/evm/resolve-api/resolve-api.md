## What is the Resolve API?

The Resolve API is a set of endpoints that helps Web3 developers resolve ENS names and Unstoppable domains.

## Resolve API Features

The Resolve API provides the following functionality out of the box to power the dapps you are building:

- Resolve an ETH address and find the ENS name.
- Resolving an Unstoppable domain and getting the address.

## Supported Chains

The Resolve API supports multiple EVM chains:
