# Token Holder Categories and Distribution

This guide explains how token holders are classified in the Moralis Holder Statistics API, including distribution categories, acquisition methods, and how to interpret holder distribution data.

## Holder Acquisition Methods

The Holder Statistics API categorizes token holders based on how they first acquired their tokens:

- **Swaps**: Holders that acquired the token via a DEX swap
- **Transfers**: Holders that acquired the token via a direct transfer
- **Airdrops**: Holders that received the token as part of an airdrop, identified by:
  - Functions that include the word `airdrop` (e.g., `airdropERC20`)
  - Transactions where the number of transfers is > 20 in a single transaction

Example airdrop transactions:

- Function named `airdropERC20`: [Example on BaseScan](https://basescan.org/tx/0xfb5f1313ead113a4f9eb181e8928186f7bab4fed943ee10d96fb9bd6bf9c1759)
- Multiple transfers: [Example on LineaScan](https://lineascan.build/tx/0x8f55c65747396df6d89d28e40993aed490567a852fe5ffb129b0bace6ff1cdd7)

## Holder Categories

Moralis categorizes holders into different "species" based on the percentage of total supply they hold. This helps analyze the distribution of token ownership and identify potential centralization risks.

### Category Thresholds

| Category | Threshold (% of Total Supply) |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| Whales   | > 0.1%                        |
| Sharks   | 0.05% - 0.1%                  |
| Dolphins | 0.005% - 0.05%                |
| Fish     | 0.001% - 0.005%               |
| Octopus  | 0.00025% - 0.001%             |
| Crabs    | 0.00015% - 0.00025%           |
| Shrimps  | < 0.00015%                    |

### Examples by Token

## Interpreting Holder Distribution

A healthy token distribution typically shows:

- **Few or no whales**: Reduces risk of price manipulation
- **Some sharks & dolphins**: Can indicate institutional or early investor interest
- **Many fish, octopus, crabs, and shrimps**: Indicates healthy retail participation and community interest

An ideal distribution has a wide base of smaller holders (shrimps, crabs) and a limited concentration at the top, resulting in a more decentralized and robust token economy.

## Using Holder Stats for Analysis

Holder statistics provide valuable insights for:

1. **Token Health Assessment**: Evaluate the decentralization and distribution of a token
2. **Growth Analysis**: Track holder growth over time (5min to 30d periods)
3. **Acquisition Pattern Analysis**: Understand how users are primarily acquiring the token
4. **Whale Watching**: Monitor large holder concentration and potential selling pressure
5. **Community Growth**: Assess retail interest through smaller holder categories

By analyzing holder statistics, you can gain a better understanding of a token's market dynamics, community health, and potential risks related to centralization.
