### What are Verified NFT Collections?

Verified NFT collections have undergone a vetting process by an NFT marketplace. When you notice a checkmark next to an NFT collection on platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, or Blur, it typically means that the actual marketplace the collection is listed on has authenticated and verified the collection.

This feature is invaluable for marketplace creators, wallet services, and analytics platforms where verification directly influences user confidence and the perceived legitimacy of a collection.

## Verification Using the NFT API

When you use [Moralis' NFT API endpoints](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/nft-api), you will notice a `verified_collection` property within the JSON response. This property determines the authenticity of an NFT collection by indicating if a contract is verified. This feature, similar to the blue tick verification on OpenSea, indicates whether a collection is officially verified.

For example, when you use the [getWalletNFTCollections](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/get-wallet-nft-collections) endpoint, each collection returned will include a `verified_collection` property set to either `true` or `false`, with `true` indicating that the NFT collection is verified.

## Supported Chains

The verification feature is currently available for NFT collections on the following blockchains:

- Ethereum
- Polygon
- BNB Smart Chain
- Arbitrum
- Avalanche
- Base
