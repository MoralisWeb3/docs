Insights into events occurring on the Ethereum blockchain are crucial for blockchain developers. Accessing this valuable data is made simpler with eth_getLogs, and one of the tools for this purpose is the [getContractLogs](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/get-contract-logs) endpoint from Moralis.

Thanks to the Moralis SDK, fetching and analyzing event logs on Ethereum is easy, and if you'd like to know how to retrieve and analyze Ethereum event logs using the SDK, this guide will be highly beneficial. It includes practical JavaScript examples, and compares Moralis' [getContractLogs](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/get-contract-logs) endpoint with the [eth_getLogs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getlogs) RPC call to help you make informed decisions.

## The Gateway to Ethereum Events with eth_getLogs

The utilization of `eth_getLogs` plays a vital role in the blockchain industry as it empowers developers with a valuable tool to monitor and analyze events occurring on the Ethereum blockchain. Throughout this guide, we will delve into the functions and benefits of this tool and look at the advantages of using Moralis instead.

Also, transaction receipts serve as repositories for Ethereum event logs, capturing details such as gas consumption, transaction status, and more. Understanding storage dynamics allows us to efficiently retrieve this information using methods like `eth_getLogs` along with other alternatives.

## Unveiling the Efficiency of Moralis' getContractLogs Endpoint

The [getContractLogs](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/get-contract-logs) endpoint from Moralis stands as a hallmark of convenience, offering an effective way to access ETH get logs. Before diving into Moralis, let's see how Moralis' getContractLogs compares against `eth_getLogs`.

### Moralisâ€™ getContractLogs vs eth_getLogs: Comparative Analysis

The `eth_getLogs` RPC call, akin to `getContractLogs`, allows fetching logs through filter objects which encapsulate parameters like `fromBlock`, `toBlock`, and `address` to define the range and source of logs. Although quite powerful, eth_getLogs requires a more detailed setup with JSON RPC calls, which might become quite complicated compared to the user-friendly, single API call facilitated by Moralis.

That said, the setup for `eth_getLogs` involves parameter settings as illustrated here:

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getLogs","params":[{"topics":["0x000000000000000000000000a94f5374fce5edbc8e2a8697c15331677e6ebf0b"]}],"id":74}'
```

It is essential to evaluate the comprehensive filtration options rendered by `eth_getLogs` against the simplified, user-friendly approach of Moralis, aligning with the project's necessities.

### A Practical Approach: JavaScript Example using Moralis

To highlight how to get started with Moralis, we present a JS script below illustrating how to employ the Moralis SDK for querying Ethereum contract logs:

```javascript
import Moralis from 'moralis';

try {
  // Initializing the Moralis SDK with your unique API key
  await Moralis.start({
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"
  });

  // Executing the getContractLogs method to retrieve contract logs
  // Here, we target the Ethereum mainnet, denoted by the "chain" parameter set to "0x1".
  // You can modify this parameter to target other networks as per your requirements.
  // The "address" parameter specifies the contract address for fetching the logs.
  const response = await Moralis.EvmApi.events.getContractLogs({
    "chain": "0x1",
    "address": "0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB",
    "topic0": "0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef"
  });

  // Logging the response enables you to inspect and understand the structure of the data retrieved.
  console.log(response);
} catch (e) {
  // Any errors arising during the execution are caught here, facilitating a clean error-handling process.
  console.error(e);
}
```

**Deciphering the Script:**
In this segment, we dissect each part of the script to offer a deep understanding of utilizing the Moralis library effectively:
- **Import and initialization:** Start by importing the Moralis library and initializing the SDK using your API key.
- **Log retrieval:** This part describes how to retrieve contract logs using defined parameters.
- **Response and error handling:** This section underlines the response logging and error management process.

## Creating Real-World Applications

Embark on a hands-on tutorial to build applications capable of querying Ethereum smart contract event logs utilizing Moralis.

In this step-by-step guide, you will learn how to create a NodeJS and NextJS application to query Ethereum smart contract event logs using Moralis. Understanding the backend and frontend code in their respective breakdown sections will help you understand the overall structure and functionality of the application.

### Step 1: Cloning and Setting Up the Project

Using the Moralis Events API, you will build a robust application capable of querying ant Ethereum smart contract event logs. Now, the steps to setting up the project include cloning the project from a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/youtube-tutorials/tree/main/get-contract-logs) and installing the necessary Node packages:

```bash
npm i moralis @moralisweb3/common-evm-utils dotenv express
```

### Step 2: Backend Code Breakdown

Dive into the backend construction using Express and the Moralis SDK. The following example outlines how to set up an Express server and define a route to handle the logs retrieval:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 5001;
const Moralis = require("moralis").default;
const cors = require("cors");
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

const MORALIS_API_KEY = process.env.MORALIS_API_KEY;

app.get("/getlogs", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { query } = req;
    const response = await Moralis.EvmApi.events.getContractLogs({
      address: query.address,
      chain: query.chain,
      topic0: query.topic0,
    });
    return res.status(200).json(response);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(`Something went wrong ${e}`);
    return res.status(400).json();
  }
});

Moralis.start({
  apiKey: MORALIS_API_KEY,
}).then(() => {
  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Listening for API Calls`);
  });
});
```

### Step 3: Frontend Code Breakdown

The following example shows how to send a request to the backend localhost API:

```javascript
const API_URL = "http://localhost:5001/getlogs";
const ADDRESS = "0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB";
const CHAIN = "0x1";
const TOPIC0 = "0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef";

const endpoint = `${API_URL}?address=${ADDRESS}&chain=${CHAIN}&topic0=${TOPIC0}`;

fetch(endpoint, { method: 'GET' })
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.log('Error:', error.message));
```

You now possess the knowledge to build a more complex application by expanding upon this basic structure.
