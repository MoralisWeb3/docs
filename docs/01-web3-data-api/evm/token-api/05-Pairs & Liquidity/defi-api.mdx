## What is the DeFi API?

The DeFi API enables Web3 developers to quickly get liquidity reserves and pair data across multiple blockchains, in order to help them build and scale their dapps efficiently.

## DeFi API Features

The DeFi API provides the following functionality out of the box to power the dapps you are building:

- Fetch the liquidity reserves for a given pair address AMMs (Uniswap-based).
- Fetch the pair address of a given token addresses from AMMs (Uniswap-based).

## Supported Chains

The DeFi API supports multiple EVM chains:

import { EVMChainData } from '@site/src/components/SupportedChains';
