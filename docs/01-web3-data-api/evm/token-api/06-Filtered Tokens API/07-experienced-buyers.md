# Tokens with Experienced Buyers

This tutorial shows you how to find tokens being bought by experienced traders - wallets with proven trading history and larger portfolios, often called "smart money."

## Basic Experienced Buyers Query

Find tokens attracting experienced traders:

```json
{
  "chains": ["eth"],
  "filters": [
    {
      "metric": "experiencedBuyers",
      "timeFrame": "oneDay",
      "gt": 50
    },
    {
      "metric": "netExperiencedBuyers",
      "timeFrame": "oneDay",
      "gt": 20
    },
    {
      "metric": "volumeUsd",
      "timeFrame": "oneDay",
      "gt": 100000
    },
    {
      "metric": "marketCap",
      "gt": 5000000
    }
  ],
  "sortBy": {
    "metric": "experiencedBuyers",
    "timeFrame": "oneDay",
    "type": "DESC"
  },
  "limit": 50
}
```

### Query Breakdown:

- `netExperiencedBuyers > 20`: More experienced buyers than sellers
- `volumeUsd > $100K`: Significant trading activity
- `marketCap > $5M`: Mid-cap or larger tokens

      "gt": 30
    },

  ]
}
```

## Warning Signs

Watch for these red flags:

- Experienced sellers > experienced buyers
- Declining liquidity with experienced selling
- Only experienced buyers (no retail interest)
- Price pumping without fundamental support

## Best Practices

1. **Confirm Across Timeframes**: Check 1h, 1d, and 1w patterns
2. **Volume Matters**: Experienced buyers need volume to impact price
3. **Check Holder Distribution**: Ensure healthy token distribution
4. **Monitor Liquidity**: Smart money needs exit liquidity
5. **Security First**: Always check security score
