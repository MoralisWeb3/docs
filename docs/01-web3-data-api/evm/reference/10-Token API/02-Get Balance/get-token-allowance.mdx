      We have plans to remove this endpoint in the future. While we do not have
      an exact date for this change yet, we will formally notify our users as
      soon as we have one via our changelog, email and socials. We will provide
      at least a 60-day notice period before discontinuing the endpoint.

      We highly recommend transitioning to our new endpoint{" "}
