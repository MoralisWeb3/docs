## What is Disable Totals?

:::caution Deprecating Feature

For any API that has `disable_totals` as an input parameter and `total` as an output responses, this feature will be deprecated soon. For announcements, please subscribe to the [Changelog](/changelog) page.
:::

`disable_totals` is an optional input parameter that allows you to control whether the `total` field returned with your Moralis API responses. By default, `disable_totals` is set to `true` if not specified, which will result in the `total` having a `null` value. Therefore, if you need to have the `total` field in your responses, make sure to set `disable_totals` as `false` within each of your API calls.

### Use Cases

Disable Totals feature is created to improve query speed performance on Moralis API by 10x. This is possible because disabling the calculation of totals will save Moralis a huge amount of computing resources and thus results in faster response times.

However, if you need `total` field within your application, then Disable Totals feature might be irrelevant for you and you should instead set the `disable_totals` value to `false` to disable it.

## Disable Totals with Moralis API

To enable Disable Totals feature, you can simply set the `disable_totals` value to `true` to the options object when calling Moralis.

The following example shows how you can implement disable totals using the Moralis SDKs.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="index.js (JavaScript)" default>

```js
const Moralis = require("moralis").default;

try {
  const address = "0x26fcbd3afebbe28d0a8684f790c48368d21665b5";

  const chain = "eth";

  const disableTotal = true;

  await Moralis.start({
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    // ...and any other configuration
  });

  const response = await Moralis.EvmApi.nft.getWalletNFTs({
    address,
    chain,
    disableTotal,
  });

  console.log(response?.result);
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="index.ts (TypeScript)">

```ts
import Moralis from "moralis";

try {
  const address = "0x26fcbd3afebbe28d0a8684f790c48368d21665b5";

  const chain = "eth";

  const disableTotal = true;

  await Moralis.start({
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    // ...and any other configuration
  });

  const response = await Moralis.EvmApi.nft.getWalletNFTs({
    address,
    chain,
    disableTotal,
  });

  console.log(response?.result);
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="index.py (Python)">

```py
from moralis import evm_api

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
params = {
    "address": "0x26fcbd3afebbe28d0a8684f790c48368d21665b5",
    "chain": "eth",
    "disable_total": True
}

result = evm_api.nft.get_wallet_nfts(
    api_key=api_key,
    params=params,
)

print(result)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
