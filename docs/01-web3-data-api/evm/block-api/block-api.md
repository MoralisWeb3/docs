## What is the Block API?

The Block API enables Web3 developers to quickly get data on specific blocks across multiple blockchains, in order to help them build and scale their dapps efficiently.

## Block API Features

The Block API provides the following functionality out of the box to power the dapps you are building:

- fetching the contents of a block given the block hash
- fetching the closest block given the date

Plus so much more!

## Popular use cases

The Block API is extremely flexible, meaning it can support a wide range of use cases, including: 

- Block Explorer
- Transaction Monitoring
- Log Explorers
- Wallet Activity

## Supported chains

The Block API supports multiple EVM chains:
