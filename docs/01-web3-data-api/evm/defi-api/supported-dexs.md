The Moralis DeFi API is integrated with an extensive range of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), operating across numerous EVM blockchains. A comprehensive list of these supported DEXs is presented in the subsequent table for your reference.

| Chain       | Supported DEX(s)                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Eth mainnet | `uniswapv2`, `uniswapv3`, `sushiswapv2`   |
| Polygon     | `uniswapv2`, `uniswapv3`, `quickswapv2`   |
| BSC         | `uniswapv2`, `uniswapv3`, `pancakeswapv1` |
| Avalanche   | `traderjoe`, `pangolin`                   |
| Fantom      | `spookyswap`                              |
| Cronos      | `vvs`                                     |
| Arbitrum    | `uniswapv3`, `camelotv2`                  |

In the event that no `exchange` value is specified, the API will proceed to systematically evaluate each exchange. It continues this process until it successfully locates a price, strategically bypassing any exchanges or pairs that are characterized by low liquidity.
