For all collections that have metadata on IPFS we automatically refresh token metadata each time those tokens are requested on any NFT endpoint.

Each time a token is requested, it will be queued for metadata refresh.


### Cool-off period
Refreshing metadata is resource intensive - therefore we have a cool-off period during which the same token canâ€™t be refreshed more than once.

If the `token_uri` points to IPFS - we allow refreshing every 10 minutes for each individual token.
