## Introduction

This tutorial shows you how to create a basic NextJS dapp that uses the [@moralisweb3/next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moralisweb3/next) to display native balance.

You can find the repository with the final code here: <https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/demo-apps/tree/main/nextjs>

## The Steps We Will Take

1. Create a NextJS app
2. Import and set up the latest @moralis/next
3. Integrate your application with Moralis services
4. Read any blockchain data from any blockchain 

## Prerequisites

1. Create a [Moralis account](https://www.moralis.io)
2. Install and set up your editor of choice (we will use VSC in this tutorial)
3. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

## Create a NextJS Dapp

For this part of the tutorial, we will create a dapp that displays the native balance, ERC-20 tokens, and NFTs for any address and EVM chain!ðŸš€

1. Create a new folder for your project and open it in your editor
2. Initialize a new project:

```shell
npm init
```



Give it a name and fill in the details as you want (press `enter` to use the default options). You should now have a `package.json` file that looks something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "simple-nextjs-demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```



3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install moralis @moralisweb3/next next-auth next react react-dom
```

4. OpenÂ `package.json`Â and add the followingÂ scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "next lint"
}
```



5. Create a `pages` directoryÂ at the root of your application and add the `index.jsx` file with the following content:

```javascript
function HomePage() {
  return <div>Welcome to my Next.js dApp!</div>
}

export default HomePage
```

:::info

NextJS is built around the concept ofÂ [pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages). A page is aÂ [React component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)Â exported from aÂ .js,Â .jsx,Â .ts, orÂ .tsxÂ file in theÂ pagesÂ directory.

:::

## Add Moralis to Your NextJS Dapp

1. Get your Web3 API key from the [Moralis dashboard](https://admin.moralis.io/): 

![Admin Panel](/img/content/05df856-4n3pANatV2_KA3lpaig2g_screenshot-2022-08-08-at-150705.webp)

2. Create a `.env.local` file at the root and add a new environment variable, `MORALIS_API_KEY`; enter your API key as the value:

```text .env.local
MORALIS_API_KEY=replace_me
```



:::info

NextJS `.env.local` variables are accessible to the entire application and are never exposed to the browser. They are stored only on the server side, which makes them safe.

:::

3. After `.env.local` is added, you can start your app:

```shell
npm run dev
```



:::caution

Every time you modify the `.env.local` file, you need to restart your app.

:::

### Setup @moralisweb3/next

To use Moralis APIs in your NextJS project create a resolver file `pages/api/moralis/[...moralis].ts` with the following code:

```javascript
import { MoralisNextApi } from "@moralisweb3/next";

export default MoralisNextApi({ apiKey: process.env.MORALIS_API_KEY });
```

You can provide a configuration object to the MoralisNextApi.

### Your first @moralisweb3/next hook call and blockchain data

1. Let's fetch Evm native balance! Add `useEvmNativeBalance` hook to `pages/index.jsx`:

```javascript
import { useEvmNativeBalance } from '@moralisweb3/next';

function HomePage() {
    const address = '0x1...';
    const { data: nativeBalance } = useEvmNativeBalance({ address });
    return (
        <div>
            <h3>Wallet: {address}</h3>
            <h3>Native Balance: {nativeBalance?.balance.ether} ETH</h3>
        </div>
    );
}

export default HomePage;


```



2. Now, let's receive and use the props in our server-side Visit the [<http://localhost:3000`>](<http://localhost:3000/native`>) page to see the results:
