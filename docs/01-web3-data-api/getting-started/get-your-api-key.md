:::info Keep Your API Key Safe

Your API key is linked to your private account. Keep your keys safe by following these best practices:

- Provide access only to those who need it
- Keep the key out of any version control system you might be using
- Use a password manager or secret management service to control access to your key
- Don't embed your secret API key in web applications or in other places where the key could be easily obtained
