A token ID hash in the Aptos Network is a unique identifier used to represent a specific token within the blockchain-based network.
When a new NFT is created on the Aptos Network, it is assigned a unique token ID hash that is generated using a cryptographic hash function. This hash function takes in the following inputs:

- `creator`: The address of the person or entity that created the NFT.
- `collection`: A string that represents the collection of which the NFT is a part of. For example, a collection of NFTs representing digital artwork by a particular artist.
- `name`: A string that represents the name of the NFT.

The hash function takes these inputs and produces a fixed-length string of characters that serves as the NFT's unique identifier on the blockchain network.
The NFT token ID hash is used to distinguish between different NFTs on the network and to prevent collisions between NFT names. It also ensures that each NFT on the network has a unique identifier that can be used to track its ownership and transaction history.
