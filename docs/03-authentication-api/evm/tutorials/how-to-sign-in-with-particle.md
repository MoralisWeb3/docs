## What is Particle Network?

:::tip
Check the Particle Network [documentation website](https://docs.particle.network/) to get more information.

**Particle Network** is the Intent-Centric, Modular Access Layer of Web3. With Particle's [Smart Wallet-as-a-Service](https://blog.particle.network/announcing-our-smart-wallet-as-a-service-modular-stack-upgrading-waas-with-erc-4337/), developers can curate unparalleled user experience through modular and customizable EOA/AA embedded wallet components. By utilizing MPC-TSS for key management, Particle can streamline onboarding via familiar Web2 accountsâ€”such as Google accounts, email addresses, and phone numbers.

## Prerequisites

### Next.js Dapp with MetaMask Sign-In

Before you begin this tutorial, make sure you have set up a Next.js decentralized application (Dapp) that includes MetaMask sign-in functionality. If you haven't integrated MetaMask sign-in yet, refer to the guide [How to Authenticate Users with MetaMask](/authentication-api/evm/how-to-sign-in-with-metamask).

### Install Dependencies

To prepare for this tutorial, you'll need to install the following dependencies for Particle Connect:

- **@particle-network/connect-react-ui**: This package provides React UI components for Particle Connect. You can install it using npm or yarn.

  ```bash
  npm install @particle-network/connect-react-ui
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  yarn add @particle-network/connect-react-ui
  ```

- **@particle-network/connect**: This package is essential for integrating Particle Connect into your Dapp. Install it using npm or yarn.

  ```bash
  npm install @particle-network/connect
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  yarn add @particle-network/connect
  ```

- **@particle-network/chains**: This optional dependency is leveraged for handling blockchain chains within Particle Connect. You can install it using npm or yarn.

  ```bash
  npm install @particle-network/chains
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  yarn add @particle-network/chains
  ```

With these prerequisites organized, you'll be fully prepared to smoothly integrate Particle Connect into your Next.js Dapp.

## Configure Particle Connect

Open the `pages/signin.jsx` file and restructure your code as shown below. This code utilizes Particle Connect's components and hooks for handling the connection process and wallet interactions.

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useAccount, ConnectButton, useConnectKit, ModalProvider } from '@particle-network/connect-react-ui';
import { useAuthRequestChallengeEvm } from '@moralisweb3/next';
import { signIn } from 'next-auth/react';
import { Ethereum } from '@particle-network/chains';
import { evmWallets } from '@particle-network/connect';
import '@particle-network/connect-react-ui/dist/index.css';

export default function SignIn() {
  const { requestChallengeAsync } = useAuthRequestChallengeEvm();
  const { push } = useRouter();
  const account = useAccount();
  const connect = useConnectKit();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (account) {
      (async () => {
        const { message } = await requestChallengeAsync({
          address: account,
          chainId: '0x1',
        });

        const signature = await connect.particle.evm.personalSign(`0x${Buffer.from(message).toString('hex')}`); // Conversion to hex, then signing with connected Particle account (whether that be through Particle Auth or otherwise)

        const result = await signIn("moralis-auth", {
          message,
          signature,
          redirect: false,
          callbackUrl: '/user',
        });

        if (result && result.url) {
          push(result.url);
        }
      })();
    }
  }, [account]);

  return (
    <ModalProvider
      options={{ // Options for Particle Auth; the projectId, clientKey, and appId can be retrieved from https://dashboard.particle.network/
        projectId: process.env.PARTICLE_PROJECT_ID,
        clientKey: process.env.PARTICLE_CLIENT_KEY,
        appId: process.env.PARTICLE_APP_ID,
        chains: [Ethereum],
        wallets: evmWallets({ showQrModal: true, projectId: process.env.WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID }), // WalletConnect for Web3 wallet connections (non Particle Auth)
      }}
    >
      <div>
        <h3>Web3 Authentication</h3>
        <ConnectButton />
      </div>
    </ModalProvider>
  );
}
```

## Test Particle Connect

To test the authentication process with Particle Connect, follow these steps:

1. **Visit Sign-In Page**: Go to [`http://localhost:3000/signin`](http://localhost:3000/signin).

2. **Connect Wallet**: Click the "Connect Wallet" button to initiate the login process. You can choose to log in through Particle Auth or a supported Web3 (EVM) wallet.

3. **Select Sign-In Method**: Choose your preferred sign-in method from the options provided.

4. **Successful Authentication**: After successful authentication, you will be automatically redirected to the `/user` page.

5. **Test User Session**: Visit [`http://localhost:3000/user`](http://localhost:3000/user) to test the functionality of the user session:

   - When a user is authenticated, their information will be displayed on the page.
   - If a user is not authenticated, they will be redirected to the `/signin` page.
   - Even after refreshing the page, the user's information will still be displayed. (_**Explanation:** After Web3 wallet authentication, the `next-auth` library creates a session cookie with an encrypted [JWT] containing session information, stored in the user's browser._)
