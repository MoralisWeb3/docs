To use the SDKs you need an API key. If you don't have one yet, you can get one for free by [signing up for a free account](/web3-data-api/evm/get-your-api-key).

## Best practices

- Don't commit your API key with your code. Instead use an environment variable
- Don't share your API key
- Avoid exposing the API key in your client-side code. If you want to access the APIs in the client, then make sure to limit the access for the API key.
