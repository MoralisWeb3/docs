We're currently working on an endpoint that will allow customers to programmatically submit possible spam contracts for review. If a contract meets our criteria, it will be marked as spam. 

In the meantime, manual reports can be submitted via our public submission board at [https://roadmap.moralis.io/b/report-spam-contracts/](https://roadmap.moralis.io/b/report-spam-contracts/)
