Create a stream by choosing one of these options:

1. Use one of the examples to create a demo stream with real-time data streaming into the right hand terminal.
2. Use a template and enter a `Contract address`, `Wallet address`, `Token address`, or `Token Id` depending on the template to create a demo stream.
3. Input a `Contract address`, `Wallet address`, `Token address` in `Add Address to Stream` and then configure your stream.

## Use Examples to create a stream

Lets choose the `Tether` Example. Simply, click the Example and the demo stream will be created. You will see the webhook responses streaming in the right hand terminal.

## Use Templates to create a stream

Lets track transactions of a wallet.

2. Enter the wallet address you want to track. Or take a example wallet address like `0xe692869347b9b18Ef2DEED19ae1bBACE303B52B0` from [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe692869347b9b18ef2deed19ae1bbace303b52b0).

When a transaction occurs on the wallet it will appear on the right hand terminal.

4. To get the webhook sent to your backend you have to configure your stream by adding `Webhook URL`, `Description`, and `Tag`.
