There is an option `getNativeBalances` when creating or editing a Stream. It is a list of native balances calls for specific addresses.

You can get Native Balances (ETH/BNB/MATIC and many more) of addresses that appear in your Webhook. They are very similar to [Triggers](/streams-api/evm/triggers).

# Native Balance Trigger

```json Native Balance Trigger Example
"getNativeBalances": [
  {
  	selectors: ["$fromAddress", "$toAddress"],
    type: 'tx'
  }
]
```

- `selectors` is a list of [valid Selectors](/streams-api/evm/triggers#selectors), for each selector you will get the native balance in the Webhook.
- `type` for which part of the Webhook you want to select the addresses. [Valid Types](/streams-api/evm/triggers#type) and also `internalTx`is allowed!

# Response

The Webhook introduces a new field `nativeBalances` that has the balances uniquely ordered by the triggers:
