Let's create a stream that monitors all the ERC20 contract transfers where sender is a specific address and the number of coins transferred is over 1000.

Note: This stream uses listen to all addresses feature that is available only on Business and Enterprise plans.

Note: There could be few ERC20 contracts that don't follow the standards, and they may use a different ABI for transfers.

Note: You will use the ABI specific to ERC20 transfers, the one that doesn't have indexed for third parameter.

### Programmatically

```javascript
const ERC20_transfer_ABI = [{
  "anonymous": false,
  "inputs": [
    { "indexed": true, "name": "from", "type": "address" },
    { "indexed": true, "name": "to", "type": "address" },
    { "indexed": false, "name": "value", "type": "uint256" },
  ],
  "name": "transfer",
  "type": "event",
}]; // valid abi of the event

const filter_ERC20 = {  
  "and": \[  
    { "eq": ["from", "0x283af0b28c62c092c9727f1ee09c02ca627eb7f5"] },  
    { "gt": ["value", "1000000000"] }, // Example of USDT (6 Decimals) 
  ],  
}; // only receive ERC20 contract transfers where sender is a specific address and the number of coins transferred is over 1000

const options = {
  chains: [EvmChain.ETHEREUM], // list of blockchains to monitor
  description: "monitor all ERC20 transfers", // your description
  tag: "ERC20_transfers", // give it a tag
  abi: ERC20_transfer_ABI,
  includeContractLogs: true,
  allAddresses: true,
  topic0: ["transfer(address,address,uint256)"], // topic of the event
  advancedOptions: [
    {
      topic0: "transfer(address,address,uint256)",
      filter: filter_ERC20
    },
  webhookUrl: "https://YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL", // webhook url to receive events,
};

const stream = await Moralis.Streams.add(options);


```



### Via WebUI

1. Create a new Stream
2. Fill out the form
3. Switch on Event Emittance and Add the Abi and select the topic
4. Select `Listen to all addresses` and `Contract interactions (logs)`
5. Add below value to advanced options
6. ```
   [  
     {  
       "topic0": "transfer(address,address,uint256)",  
       "filter": {  
         "and": [  
           { "eq": ["from", "0x283af0b28c62c092c9727f1ee09c02ca627eb7f5"] },  
           { "gt": ["value", "1000000000"] }   // Example of USDT (6 Decimals) 
         ]  
       }  
     }  
   ]
   ```
