# Extended RPC Methods Overview

Moralis offers a powerful suite of extended RPC methods to enhance your blockchain development experience. These methods provide deep insights and functionalities beyond standard RPC calls, making it easier for developers to interact with and analyze blockchain data. Below, youâ€™ll find an overview of the available extended RPC methods, what they do, and how they can be utilized.

## What are Extended RPC Methods?

Extended RPC methods are custom API calls provided by Moralis that allow developers to perform advanced queries and retrieve additional data about transactions, tokens, and NFTs on various blockchains. These methods build upon traditional RPC calls by offering more specific and detailed information, making blockchain data more accessible and useful for your applications.
