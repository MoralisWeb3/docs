# RPC Nodes Overview

Welcome to the Moralis RPC Nodes documentation! This section will guide you through everything you need to know to effectively use Moralis RPC Nodes for accessing blockchain data across various supported networks. Our RPC nodes provide a powerful and reliable gateway for interacting with blockchain networks using standard JSON-RPC calls.

---

## What Are RPC Nodes?

RPC (Remote Procedure Call) nodes allow developers to interact with blockchain networks without the need to run their own full node. By sending **JSON-RPC** requests to Moralis RPC Nodes, you can:

- Query blockchain data (e.g., block and transaction information).
- Interact with smart contracts.
- Fetch NFT and token balances.
- Send transactions and monitor on-chain events.

Moralis simplifies this process by providing reliable, scalable access to RPC nodes across major blockchain networks.

## JSON-RPC and Extended RPC Methods

Moralis offers full support for the standard **JSON-RPC** 2.0 specification, making it easy to integrate with any existing Ethereum or EVM-compatible tools.

In addition to standard JSON-RPC methods, Moralis provides **extended RPC methods** that allow for more advanced queries, such as:

- Fetching token balances.
- Fetching NFT holdings.
- Fetching transaction history.

To learn more about the available methods, visit the [Standard vs Extended RPC Methods](./rpc-methods) page.

## Rate Limiting and Usage Limits

Moralis enforces rate limits at the **account level** to ensure fair usage across all users. Each account has a set number of allowed requests per minute, based on your plan. For more information on rate limits and how to optimize your usage, visit our [FAQ](/rpc-faqs) page.
