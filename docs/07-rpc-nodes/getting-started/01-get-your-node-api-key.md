# Getting Started with Moralis Nodes

Moralis simplifies the process of accessing data from nodes across various blockchains, and this guide is designed to walk you through the steps to get started with Moralis Nodes.

## Step 1: Create a Moralis Account

To start, sign up for a complimentary Moralis account by navigating to the [Moralis Dashboard](https://admin.moralis.io/).

## Step 2: Access your Node URL

To begin using Nodes, you must generate your unique node URL by following these steps:

- Log in to your Moralis Dashboard.
- On the sidebar menu, click on the "Nodes" tab, then select "Create a new node." Choose your preferred blockchain and specify whether you want access to the mainnet or testnet.

## Step 3: Start using your node from your application

Once you have set up your Node, you're all set to begin utilizing it by making RPC calls from your application. Simply copy one of the two provided URLs (either site 1 or site 2), each of which contains your Node API key. Integrate this URL into your application, and you're ready to start interacting with the Node.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully created your Moralis account, acquired your Moralis Node URL along with your Node API Key, and begun making calls to your Moralis Node.

You're now prepared to delve further into Moralis and discover its extensive features. For those interested in learning more about the Moralis Node and the various RPC Requests it supports, you can find detailed information on this [here (link to RPC methods Compute unit page)].

Happy coding with Moralis!
