# Getting Started with Moralis Nodes

Moralis simplifies the process of accessing blockchain data from nodes across various blockchains. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your Moralis RPC node and get started quickly.

## Step 1: Create a Moralis Account

To begin, you’ll need a Moralis account. Sign up for a free account by heading to the [Moralis Dashboard](https://admin.moralis.com/).

## Step 2: Access Your Node URL

After signing up, the next step is to generate your unique **Node URL**. Follow these steps:

1. **Log in** to your Moralis Dashboard.
2. From the sidebar, click on the **"Nodes"** tab.
3. Select **"Create a New Node"**.

Here, you can choose the blockchain network you want to connect to (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon) and specify whether you want access to the **mainnet** or **testnet**.

Once you’ve selected your network and environment, click **"Create Node"** to generate your node.

## Step 3: Copy Your Node URL

Once your node is created, you will be provided with two URLs—one for **site 1** and another for **site 2**. Both URLs include your **Node API Key**.

Simply copy one of these URLs. This is your unique **Node URL**, which you'll use to interact with the blockchain in your application.

Make sure to keep your Node URL safe, as it contains your API key, which is essential for connecting to the blockchain.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully created your Moralis account and generated your unique Node URL. You’re now ready to start making RPC calls using your node.

To move forward and learn how to make your first RPC call, check out the next guide in the series: [Making Your First RPC Call](#).
