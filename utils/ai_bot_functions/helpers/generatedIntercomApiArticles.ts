    body: 'Sample Code\nTo get the first transaction of a contract, you can utilize the Moralis getWalletActiveChains API. Here\'s a simple example of how to use it:\n\nconst Moralis = require("moralis").default;const { EvmChain } = require("@moralisweb3/common-evm-utils");const runApp = async () => {await Moralis.start({apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",});const address = "0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d";const chains = [EvmChain.ETHEREUM];const response = await Moralis.EvmApi.wallets.getWalletActiveChains({address,chains,});console.log(response.toJSON());}runApp();\nI used an NFT contract address for the example. \nThe response from the above code will provide details about the first transaction, including the date and block number:\n\n{  "address": "0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d",  "active_chains": [    {      "chain": "eth",      "chain_id": "0x1",      "first_transaction": {        "block_timestamp": "2021-04-22T23:13:40.000Z",        "block_number": "12292922",        "transaction_hash": "0xcfb197f62ec5c7f0e71a11ec0c4a0e394a3aa41db5386e85526f86c84b3f2796"      },      "last_transaction": {        "block_timestamp": "2023-09-13T09:14:11.000Z",        "block_number": "18126424",        "transaction_hash": "0x7414c1dcb63cf87e17a694419c13c231906571ce5d4d11c4f2aa76aa3a8cd8b6"      }    }  ]}\n\nUse Cases\n\n\nGetting the Age of the Contract Address: By retrieving the first transaction\'s timestamp, you can easily determine the age of a contract. This can be useful for analytics, trust scoring, or other analytical purposes.\n\n\nFetching Initial Transactions: With the block number of the first transaction, you can retrieve a set of subsequent initial transactions of the NFT contract using getNFTContractTransfers.\nFor instance, to get the early transactions of a contract using the fromBlock and toBlock values:\n\nconst response = await await Moralis.EvmApi.nft.getNFTContractTransfers({"chain": EvmChain.ETHEREUM,"fromBlock": 12292922,"toBlock": 12293022, "address": "0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d","format": "decimal"});\nThis will fetch transactions from block 12292922 to 12293022, giving you a snapshot of the contract\'s early activities and making it easy to retrieve the initial transactions of a contract without having to paginate through all the transaction data.',

    body: 'As of 11th September 2023, the total value returned on the endpoints will no longer be returned. This means that we deprecated the disable_total parameter and total field value. You can read about this update in the changelog (https://docs.moralis.io/changelog/essential-api-changes).\n\nNew Endpoints: We have introduced five new endpoints that will replace the deprecated total value:\n\n\nGet Wallet Stats - /wallets/{address}/stats\n\n\nGet NFT Collection Stats - /nft/{address}/stats\n\n\nGet NFT Token Id Stats - /nft/{address}/{token_id}/stats\n\n\nGet ERC20 Token Stats - /erc20/{address}/stats\n\n\nGet Block  Stats - /block/{block_number_or_hash}/stats\n\nMigration Guide: The article provides a guide on how to migrate existing code to use the new stats endpoints, specifically focusing on the NFT collections stats endpoint.\n\nDefine a Function: \nDefine a new function to use the NFT collections stats and return the required total value. \nThe response from the NFT Collection stats looks like below. For this code example, we only use the total value of NFT owners.\n{   "total_tokens": "10007",   "owners": { "current": "10007" }, // 👈 required total owners value  "transfers": { "total": "24582" },  "trades": { "total": "1" }}\n\nThe below function code will return the NFT owner\'s total\n// app.jsconst getTotalOwners = async (address, chain) => {const url = `https://deep-index.moralis.io/api/v2.2/nft/${address}/stats?chain=${chain}`;const response = await fetch(url, {method: "GET",  headers: {    accept: "application/json",    "X-API-Key": "Moralis_API_KEY",  },});const data = await response.json();return data.owners.current; // 👈 returns the total owners value};\n\nIntegrate with Existing Code:\nNow you can use the getTotalOwners function in your existing code to get the total owners and calculate the total pages.\n// app.jsconst Moralis = require("moralis").default;const init = async () => {const address = "0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB"; const chain = "0x1";await Moralis.start({    apiKey: "Moralis_API_KEY",  });// 👇 using the getTotalOwners function to get the total owners value and //    calculating the total pagesconst totalOwners = await getTotalOwners(address, chain);const pageSize = 100; const totalPages = Math.ceil(totalOwners / pageSize); let cursor = null; let owners = {}; for (let currentPage = 1; currentPage <= totalPages; currentPage++) { const response = await Moralis.EvmApi.nft.getNFTOwners({   address,   chain,   limit: pageSize,   cursor: cursor,   disableTotal: false, }); console.log( `Got page ${currentPage} of ${totalPages}, ${totalOwners} total` ); for (const NFT of response.result) {   if (NFT.ownerOf.checksum in owners) {        owners[NFT.ownerOf.checksum].push({         amount: NFT.amount,         owner: NFT.ownerOf,         tokenId: NFT.tokenId,         tokenAddress: NFT.tokenAddress,       });     } else {       owners[NFT.ownerOf.checksum] = [       {        amount: NFT.amount,        owner: NFT.ownerOf,        tokenId: NFT.tokenId,        tokenAddress: NFT.tokenAddress,      },    ];  }} cursor = response.pagination.cursor; } console.log("owners:", owners, "total owners:", Object.keys(owners).length);};init();\n\nBy following the above steps, you can seamlessly integrate the new stats endpoints into your existing code.

Moralis provides you with Streams API to listen to real-time events on the various blockchain that we supported.\n\nIn order to listen to the swap events that occur on the blockchain. All you need is the Swap events, the contract that emits the Swap events, along with its corresponding ABI.\n\nAuthentication API\nThe Authentication API can be used to authenticate and verify various web3 authentication methods. The Authentication API is agnostic to the wallets you use and you should be able to use this to connect your various wallet to your dapp.\n\nYou can learn more on how to authenticate using Authentication API with various wallets, e.g. Metamask (https://docs.moralis.io/authentication-api/evm/how-to-authenticate-users-with-metamask-using-react), WalletConnect (https://docs.moralis.io/authentication-api/evm/how-to-sign-in-with-walletconnect), Web3Auth (https://docs.moralis.io/authentication-api/evm/how-to-sign-in-with-web3authio), and others in our official documentation (https://docs.moralis.io/). \n\nMore Resources\nTo learn more on how to build a DEX step-by-step, watch the following tutorial:\n\n![Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/t8U7GRrlYW8?rel=0)",

    body: "Yes, it does.\n\nMoralis v2 is comprised of an all-API service that is built based on the REST API standard, which can be called in any programming language. Using the various functions and libraries such as fetch, axios, and others you should be able to call Moralis APIs in React Native easily.\n\nAlternatively, you can also call Moralis API indirectly from the backend. Moralis v2 currently provides SDK to call the API easily in both NodeJS and Python and by building a server with the SDKs, you should be able to use the backend as a proxy to call Moralis API for your React Native decentralized application.

    url: "https://help.moralis.io/en/articles/43673-understanding-webhooks-for-transaction-confirmation",
    body: "The Streams API provides two webhooks for each block that contains the event you are interested in. One with confirmed: false when the transaction is initially mined and one with confirmed: true when the transaction is confirmed after a certain number of blocks. By understanding these webhooks and the number of confirmations required for your blockchain, you can effectively monitor and track your transactions.\n\nWhen a block is initially mined, you will receive a webhook with confirmed: false. This webhook indicates that the transaction has been added to a block but has not yet been reached the number of block confirmations required. You can use this webhook to track the progress of the transaction and take necessary actions, such as sending notifications to users or updating a database.\n\nOnce the block is confirmed, you will receive a second webhook with confirmed: true. This webhook indicates that the transaction has been successfully executed and fulfilled the number of confirmations required by the network. The number of confirmations required varies based on the blockchain you are using.\n\nTo determine the number of confirmations required for your blockchain, please refer to the table below. You can find this information under the Confirmation Blocks column for each supported chain.\n\n\nREORGANIZATION BEFORE CONFIRMATION\nUntil a block is confirmed, it is possible that a re-organization of the chain may occur, invalidating some information. If a re-organization does occur before a block is confirmed, the information associated with the block is deleted and the updated block is inserted in its place.\n\n\n\n\nChain\n\n\nChain Id (HEX)\n\n\nInternal Transaction Supported\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBlocks until confirmed\n\n\n\n\nETH\n\n\n0x1\n\n\n✅ YES\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\nGOERLI\n\n\n0x5\n\n\n✅ YES\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\nSEPOLIA\n\n\n0xaa36a7\n\n\n✅ YES\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\nBNB\n\n\n0x38\n\n\n✅ YES\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\nBNB TEST\n\n\n0x61\n\n\n✅ YES\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\nPOLYGON\n\n\n0x89\n\n\n✅ YES\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nMUMBAI\n\n\n0x13881\n\n\n✅ YES\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nFANTOM TEST\n\n\n0xfa2\n\n\n✅ YES\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nFANTOM\n\n\n0xfa\n\n\n✅ YES\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nAVAX\n\n\n0xa86a\n\n\n✅ YES\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nAVAX TEST\n\n\n0xa869\n\n\n✅ YES\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nCRONOS\n\n\n0x19\n\n\n❌ Very soon\n\n\nPlanned support within a couple of days\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nCRONOS TEST\n\n\n0x152\n\n\n❌ Very soon\n\n\nPlanned support within a couple of days\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nRONIN\n\n\n0x7e4\n\n\n✅ YES\n\n\n🔥 NEW\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nARBITRUM\n\n\n0xa4b1\n\n\n✅ YES\n\n\n🔥 NEW\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nARBITRUM TEST\n\n\n0x66eed\n\n\n✅ YES\n\n\n🔥 NEW\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nOPTIMISM\n\n\n0xa\n\n\n\n\n\n🔥 NEW\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nPALM\n\n\n0x2a15c308d\n\n\n\n\n\n🔥 NEW\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nAPTOS MAINNET\n\n\nmainnet\n\n\nNot Applicable\n\n\n🔥 NEW\n\n\nNot Applicable\n\n\n\n\nAPTOS TESTNET\n\n\ntestnet\n\n\nNot Applicable\n\n\n🔥 NEW\n\n\nNot Applicable\n\n\n\n",

This means the block in which the event occurred still runs the risk of getting dropped because of blockchain reorganization. You are not charged for unconfirmed webhooks, only for the confirmed ones.\nThe second webhook will come once the block in which the event happened has minimal chance of being dropped (the chance is never zero as it is all probabilistic). This second webhook will have confirmed:true.\n\n\nEdge Cases\nIn rare cases, the webhook with confirmed:true may come before the one with confirmed:false; please ensure to handle this scenario on your end.\n',

    body: "All Moralis plans have generous limits on the number of requests you can make. How many included compute units  you have depends on the plan you have, check the pricing page (https://moralis.io/pricing) for more details.\nIn most cases, one request to the Web3API counts as one request towards your monthly quota (also called the Base). However, some API requests are very computationally heavy and therefore count as several compute units. \n\nSee the page Compute Units (https://docs.moralis.io/web3-data-api/compute-units-cu) for details about requests and how they are calculated.Note: for exact rate limit values the endpoint <https://deep-index.moralis.io/api/v2/info/endpointWeights>  can be used.\n\nNote: /nft/{address}/{token_id}/metadata/resync has a billing cost of 5 and a rate limit cost of 25, meaning that you can call it only once per second with a free plan and twice a second with a Pro plan\n\nYou are welcome to visit our documentation website (https://docs.moralis.io/) and YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/MoralisWeb3), for more useful resources and great tutorials on the Moralis Web3 development platform.",

    body: "It might be possible that you exceed your Monthly Compute Units limit on your current plan. To help you understand what the Monthly limits are for each plan and what to expect once it is reached, you will find below more details about the process: Free Plan - 4000 Compute Units per day  (When exceeded, the keys are automatically blocked until the next day.)Pro Plan - 15M Compute Units per month (When exceeded, additional compute units are charged)Business Plan - 30M Compute Units per month (When exceeded, additional compute units are charged)* For Enterprise plans, this might differ due to the custom plans and committed use discounts. You can always reach out to your Account Manager for more details about the Enterprise plan billing structure.\n\n[Image: https://downloads.intercomcdn.eu/i/o/1627810/3ae21102dff02b87c6f49224/Capture.PNG]Important Note: In the event that you are canceling your subscription and you exceed the monthly request limit before the subscription ends, all additional requests accrued during that period will still be charged.",

These functionalities of the Streams API would normally require many thousands of node requests, but if you use Moralis, they are included for free. This will also save you a lot of development time as our solution is fully managed and will scale as your project grows. Additionally, check out the Moralis Web3 API,  (https://docs.moralis.io/web3-data-api)which can accomplish a lot more than nodes with fewer requests.",
