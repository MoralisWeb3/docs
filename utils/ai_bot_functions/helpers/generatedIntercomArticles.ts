For example, if you are using Metamask, you can follow this guide (https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331#h_01G01W07NV7Q94M7P1EBD5BYM4) to do so.\n\nStep 3: Access Your Funds\nAt this stage, you should be able to have full access to the generated wallet and will be able to use the wallet to access your funds.\n\nIn addition, you should be able to use the wallet to connect with regular dapps and interact with smart contracts as any regular Ethereum wallet.",

Moralis provides you with Streams API to listen to real-time events on the various blockchain that we supported.\n\nIn order to listen to the swap events that occur on the blockchain. All you need is the Swap events, the contract that emits the Swap events, along with its corresponding ABI.\n\nAuthentication API\nThe Authentication API can be used to authenticate and verify various web3 authentication methods. The Authentication API is agnostic to the wallets you use and you should be able to use this to connect your various wallet to your dapp.\n\nYou can learn more on how to authenticate using Authentication API with various wallets, e.g. Metamask (https://docs.moralis.io/authentication-api/evm/how-to-authenticate-users-with-metamask-using-react), WalletConnect (https://docs.moralis.io/authentication-api/evm/how-to-sign-in-with-walletconnect), Web3Auth (https://docs.moralis.io/authentication-api/evm/how-to-sign-in-with-web3authio), and others in our official documentation (https://docs.moralis.io/). \n\nMore Resources\nTo learn more on how to build a DEX step-by-step, watch the following tutorial:\n\n![Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/t8U7GRrlYW8?rel=0)",

On top of that, we also discovered a lot of bots exploiting the high limits of our free plan. \n\nTo continue providing a sustainable free plan for all the amazing developers out there, we have set new limits that will allow most of you to continue to build for free, while eliminating most of the abuse that we see on the platform.\n\nThe new limits will be:\n\n\n4000 compute units per day for Web3 API\n\n\n300 records per day for Streams.\n\n\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nIf you are one of the few currently using more than 4000 compute units or 300 stream records per day, you can upgrade to our Pro plan (https://moralis.io/pricing/) and get 15M monthly compute units, along with many other benefits. \n\nIf you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

    body: "The Streams API provides two webhooks for each block that contains the event you are interested in. One with confirmed: false when the transaction is initially mined and one with confirmed: true when the transaction is confirmed after a certain number of blocks. By understanding these webhooks and the number of confirmations required for your blockchain, you can effectively monitor and track your transactions.\n\nWhen a block is initially mined, you will receive a webhook with confirmed: false. This webhook indicates that the transaction has been added to a block but has not yet been reached the number of block confirmations required. You can use this webhook to track the progress of the transaction and take necessary actions, such as sending notifications to users or updating a database.\n\nOnce the block is confirmed, you will receive a second webhook with confirmed: true. This webhook indicates that the transaction has been successfully executed and fulfilled the number of confirmations required by the network.

(https://academy.moralis.io/pricing)\nQuestion: How To RESET My Moralis Academy Password? (https://academy.moralis.io/forgot-password)\n\n\nQuestions from our Academy students:\n\nQuestion: Do I need to be a programmer or have programming experience to join the Academy?\nNo, you will be able to start your journey thanks to our beginner-friendly courses. We will teach you everything you need to know about blockchain and blockchain development from scratch!\nTo help new people learn about programming, it is much easier to present them with Javascript (https://academy.moralis.io/courses/javascript-programming-for-blockchain-developers) than any other language. For that specific reason, we use Javascript (https://academy.moralis.io/courses/javascript-programming-for-blockchain-developers). In fact, we start with HTML & CSS, which were primarily used at the beginning of the internet, where webpages had no logic and were of a static nature. This will help you get a feel of coding but will not propose any logic behind it. Once you feel how the code is structured, you will start implementing an actual programming language, Javascript (https://academy.moralis.io/courses/javascript-programming-for-blockchain-developers). This enables you to integrate logic inside your HTML  code, introducing you to some of the basics every programming language will have. Variable, functions, loops, and booleans are just examples each programming language will have, but their implementation will differ. Additionally, HTML, CSS, and Javascript (https://academy.moralis.io/courses/javascript-programming-for-blockchain-developers) have been here for a very long time and are used every second on the internet. Hence, the material you can find on the internet is pretty much infinite. Every idea or problem you encounter will likely have already been discussed somewhere on the internet.\n\n\nAre the courses suitable for children?\nYes! Ivan himself started coding at the age of 9 and with that in mind ensured that the courses are for all age groups, we believe the earlier you get started the better! Currently the youngest member (https://youtu.be/XrMN1KcAve8) of the academy is 12 years old! Click here to watch her amazing story (https://youtu.be/XrMN1KcAve8)\n\n\nDo you have courses for those not interested in coding?\nYes! Courses such as Blockchain Business Masterclass (https://academy.moralis.io/courses/blockchain-business-masterclass), Crypto For Beginners (https://academy.moralis.io/courses/crypto-for-beginners/) and Bitcoin Monetary Revolution (https://academy.moralis.io/courses/the-bitcoin-standard-course-history-of-money-and-bitcoin) have little to no coding involved but still focus on aspects of the Blockchain industry.\n\n\nQuestion: Can I really make money from this knowledge?\nYes! We've seen it with our own eyes! Regardless if you're interested in switching your career field, investing, or just exploring cutting-edge technology, the knowledge you'll acquire here is unique. After graduating from the Academy, you will be among the top 1% in terms of cryptocurrency and blockchain knowledge. Check out the following article from our blog: How to earn a passive income with bitcoin. (https://academy.moralis.io/blog/how-to-earn-a-passive-income-with-bitcoin-in-2020)\n\n\nQuestion: Can I try this for Free?\nWe do not have free trials. However, all our subscriptions to the Academy come with a 14 day money-back guarantee (excluding subscriptions paid in crypto). This means you can sign up and try out our products without committing financially! Go ahead and invest in yourself!\n\n\nQuestion: Why would I pay for this when I can find content for free on Youtube?\nThe learning experience you get in the Academy cannot be compared to anything else out there. Youtube can bring you some of the information, even though it often is fragmented, outdated, or hard to follow for beginners. We have spent the time to create a complete package that you can follow step by step, where we guide you by the hand and push you to learn and practice. There has also been a steady increase of crypto scams on YouTube (https://academy.moralis.io/blog/how-to-recognize-crypto-and-bitcoin-scams), by learning through the academy you are ensured transparency as well as membership to a large crypto community.\n\n\nQuestion: Can I change my plan later on?\nAbsolutely! Upgrades are indeed possible at any point by contacting support.\n\n\nQuestion: What happens if I want to cancel?\nNo worries, there are no long-term commitments or complicated contracts. If you decide that the Ivan on Tech Academy isn't right for you, you can cancel your account at any time.",

    body: "In the last few months, we’ve done a lot of work to get Moralis integrated into some of the best web2 tools out there. Not only you can now self-host the Moralis server, but you can also get both Authentication and real-time Streams integrated into popular solutions like Firebase.\nNow that we have those in place, the time has come to retire the old Moralis Server for our free plan users. From 1 December 2022, we will archive all basic servers from free plans.​\nThis only applies to free plan servers, and if you already have either purchased a paid production server or are currently on a pro plan this does not apply to you. ​\nSo how can you transition?\nThe alternative we recommend is to move to Firebase. It’s easy to use and infinitely scalable. You can also use whatever programming language you want. We have great tutorials out for Firebase.\n\n\nFirebase tutorial example for authentication:https://docs.moralis.io/docs/web3-firebase-authentication11 (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.moralis.io%2Fdocs%2Fweb3-firebase-authentication&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0dlU99VLveTvjf99BUK706)\n\n\nUsing Streams API with firebase:https://docs.moralis.io/docs/web3-firebase-streams3 (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.moralis.io%2Fdocs%2Fweb3-firebase-streams&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0SZ7NGssCW_TZTo_kVPq6p)\n\n\nYouTube videos on integrating Authentication and Streams into Firebase on our YouTube channel.\n\n\nFirebase Web3 Authentication4 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HLxYYmZp94&ab_channel=MoralisWeb3)\n\n\nUse Moralis Web3 API from Firebase Frontend2 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSg7uq2ZWgM&ab_channel=MoralisWeb3)\n\n\nStore NFT Metadata on Firebase1 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it1sxzHtvxc&ab_channel=MoralisWeb3)\n\n\nListen To Smart Contract Events with Firebase3 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUm-f2iwU3s&ab_channel=MoralisWeb3)\n\n\nListen To Blockchain Events In Real Time1 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EieJVLhpvsI&ab_channel=MoralisWeb3)\n\n\n\nThe disadvantage with Firebase is that you can’t use the Moralis v1 SDK.​\nThe second alternative is to go the self hosted route and self host the Moralis Server (Parse server). The advantage here is that you can use cloud code in the same way as before, as well as the Moralis v1 SDK. You also have support for Authentication and real-time Streams. We have some great tutorials on this as well:\n\n\nWeb3 Parse Server Authentication:https://docs.moralis.io/docs/web3-parse-server-authentication2 (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.moralis.io%2Fdocs%2Fweb3-parse-server-authentication&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2bdxhmoTA0NtgARbV0my2K)\n\n\nParse server self-hosting tutorial:https://docs.moralis.io/docs/v1-server-self-hosting6 (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.moralis.io%2Fdocs%2Fv1-server-self-hosting&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0ArQ8mTJwGuHRv8IYw-GZS)\n\n\nWeb3 Parse Server Streams:https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/parse-server-moralis-streams3 (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMoralisWeb3%2FMoralis-JS-SDK%2Ftree%2Ffeat%2Fparse-server-package%2Fpackages%2FparseServer&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3CPAKzCP6srNf2uk5CAE7c)\n\nThe disadvantage is that you have to set up the server itself and maintain it over time.You can always get help with your migration in our forum (https://forum.moralis.io/t/retiring-servers-for-free-plan-users-from-1-december-2022/20657).",

The value of the toJSON()value has changed. Now it is the same value as.raw. Previously this caused a lot of confusion, and as both return a json. The value of this method has changed. So if you used.toJSON()on an api result you can:\n\n\nUse.result, this will probably contain dataTypes with lots of utility functions. If you only care about the data, you can call.format()or.toJSON()on this datatype. This is the prefered way as it provides you wilt additional utilites and extra properties. We suggest you to use Typescript, to easily see the available properties/methods on these datatypes.\n\n\nOr. use the new values (or values from.raw), these values are identical as they are provided by the internal api, without any data transformation. The types might be different than before, so please check this (we suggest to use Typescript, as all responses are typed, otherwise you can log the output and see any differences)\n\n\nWhat exactly can break?\nThe value of the .toJSON()on api results in the JS SDK\n\nHow to ensure my app won't break?\nPostpone updating the SDK until:\n\n\nYou verified that you still get the correct results\n\n\nPrefer changing the .toJSON() to .result (if you want to use all properties) or.raw (if you only need the raw data from the api)\n\n\nWhen will this change go live and be mandatory?\n28-11-2022\n\nLink to Moralis Forum for discussions\nhttps://forum.moralis.io/t/restructure-js-sdk-api-result-from-28-november-2022/21140 (https://forum.moralis.io/t/restructure-js-sdk-api-result-from-28-november-2022/21140)\n\nCode Examples\nGive as many code examples as possible for different scenarios.\nconst { result, raw } = await Moralis.EvmApi.block.getBlock({ blockNumberOrHash: '15305775', chain: EvmChain.Ethereum, }); // In this case the result is a datatype: EvmBlock, so we can use the toJSON() method on this datatype const block = result.toJSON(); // Alternatively, the .raw value can be used, but the types and property names might differ a bit const apiData = raw\nconst { result, raw } = await Moralis.EvmApi.token.getTokenPrice({ address: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890', chain: EvmChain.Ethereum, }); // In this case the result does not return a datatype directly, but rather an object with properties as 'nativePrice' and 'exchangeAddress'. To get serializable values you can call: const price = result.nativePrice.format() const exchangeAddress = result.exchangeAddress.format() // Alternatively, the .raw value can be used, but the types and property names might differ a bit const apiData = raw\n\nBest practices\nUpdate to the new version of the SDK if:\n\n\nYou have verified the places where apiResult.toJSON() is used\n\n\nChange the value to .result or .raw\n\n\nUse Typescript to ensure the property names and types are correct\n\n",

This means the block in which the event occurred still runs the risk of getting dropped because of blockchain reorganization. You are not charged for unconfirmed webhooks, only for the confirmed ones.\nThe second webhook will come once the block in which the event happened has minimal chance of being dropped (the chance is never zero as it is all probabilistic).

This will give you the same functionalities as a Moralis server, but you are in full control.\n\n![Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/l2qTyc-V9cM?rel=0)If you are stuck\nWe want to help you to self-host and are available in this forum thread (https://forum.moralis.io/t/self-hosting-your-moralis-server/19427/4), (https://forum.moralis.io/t/self-hosting-your-moralis-server/19427/4) if you have any questions. Don't hesitate to ask!\n\nWhy self-hosting\nMigrating from the Moralis-hosted server to a self-hosted server has several benefits:\n\n\n\nYou are in completely in full control of your backend\n\n\nComplete control of your data and databases\n\n\nYou can finetune the hosting, resulting in saving costs\n\n\nYou can include any custom code, plugins, and packages in your server-code (and cloud code)\n\n\nA better developer experience, as you can run the server locally during development\n\nSelf hosting a parse-server\nYou can integrate Moralis within any backend that you want. In this guide, we will guide you to set up a parse-server. This is also used to set up the hosted Moralis servers. By setting up your own parse-server you can:\n\n\nEasily migrate from a Moralis-hosted server to a self-hosted server\n\n\nKeep your cloud-code\n\n\nKeep your frontend the same (as this setup will allow you to use the moralis-v1 and react-moralis packages)\n\n👍This guide will help you setting up your own parse-server, running it locally, and deploying it to production.\nFeatures\nMoralis is continuously improving, and not all functionalities are available yet for a self-hosted server. Below is a list of the supported features. The remaining features are in development and will soon be supported as well:\n\n\n\nAuthentication with an EVM chain\n\n\nAuthentication with a Solana chain(coming soon)\n\n\nMake requests to the EvmApi (Web3Api) via the server that implements rate-limiting\n\n\nMake requests to the SolApi via the server that implements rate-limiting\n\n\nSync real-time and historical on-chain data to the database\n\n\nPlugins(deprecated, see below)\n\nAuthentication\nAuthentication in this self-hosted server is using the Moralis Auth API. This flow looks a bit different and requires some changes in the front-end (see Connect to your client (https://docs.moralis.io/docs/connect-to-your-client)).\n\nEvmApi (WebApi) and SolApi with rate-limiting\nCalling endpoints to the APIs, are the same as before. Moralis.Web3Api.<method> will make a request to a cloud function that handles rate-limiting. Then this cloud function will make the call to the API and return the data.\n\nThese cloud functions are automatically generated (described in Configure your server (https://docs.moralis.io/docs/configure-your-server#generate-api-proxy-endpoints))\n\nSync on-chain data to the database\nSyncing data to the database on the self-hosted server is done using @moralisweb3/parse-server (https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/Moralis-JS-SDK/tree/main/packages/parseServer) package. For the example code, see demo-parse-server-migration (https://docs.moralis.io/docs/nodejs-demo-parse-server-migration)\n\nPlugins (deprecated)\nAll Moralis plugins on the hosted Moralis servers are wrappers for external APIs. These could easily be replaced by yourself on this server. All you need is the endpoint/SDK of the plugin provider, and make requests via their API-keys (this is safe now as you have full control over your backend). See the documentation of these plugins for more information.\n\nNext steps\n\n\nRun parse-server locally (https://docs.moralis.io/docs/run-parse-server-locally)\n\n\nConfigure your server (https://docs.moralis.io/docs/configure-your-server)\n\n\nMigrate your data (https://docs.moralis.io/docs/migrate-data)\n\n\nConnect to your client (https://docs.moralis.io/docs/connect-to-your-client)\n\n\nDeploy to production (https://docs.moralis.io/docs/%F0%9F%94%97)​\n\nReferences\n\nParse-server documentation (https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide)\n\nYou are welcome to visit our documentation website (https://docs.moralis.io/web3-data-api/reference/web3-api-version) and YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/MoralisWeb3/videos), for more useful resources and great tutorials on the Moralis Web3 development workflow.",

This means that the new version of the JS SDK will only support NodeJs (no browser or react-native). To continue supporting the current v1 version we forked the repo to moralis-v1 (see https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/Moralis-JS-SDK-v1 (https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/Moralis-JS-SDK-v1)). This version will receive bug fixes, small updates, and security patches.\n\nWhat exactly can break?\nUpdating to v2 of the SDK will drop support for client-side functionalities. It will not break if you have a version specified (not using latest version).\n\nHow to ensure my app won't break?\nIf you are using npm (and v1.11.0), you should switch the library from moralis to moralis-v1.\n\nIf you are using a CDN import via a <script> (and v1.11.0) then you should update it from https://unpkg.com/moralis@1.11.0/dist/moralis.js to https://unpkg.com/moralis-v1@1.11.0/dist/moralis.js.\n\nNote that this only applies if you are using the latest version of the SDK or want to update to a version of 1.11 or above. Otherwise, you can leave the version as it is right now, and update it to moralis-v1 when you upgrade to the latest version.\n\nWhen will this change go live and be mandatory?\n2022-08-10\n\nLink to Moralis Forum for discussions\nhttps://forum.moralis.io/t/moralis-v1-support-august-8-2022/18383 (https://forum.moralis.io/t/moralis-v1-support-august-8-2022/18383)\n\nCode Examples\nFor npm users\n\nnpm remove moralis\nnpm install moralis-v1\n// Old\nimport moralis from 'moralis'\n// New\nimport moralis from 'moralis-v1'\nFor CDN users\n\n<!-- Old -->\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/moralis@1.11.0/dist/moralis.js\">\n<!-- New -->\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/moralis-v1@1.11.0/dist/moralis.js\">\nBest practices\n\n\nNever use latest versions in production code, as this may result in breaking changes when Moralis updates to v2.\n\n\nThe best practice is to update your dependency to moralis-v1 as soon as possible. The code of v1.11.0 is exactly the same as moralis v1.11.0.\n\n\nIf you are using Moralis mainly in NodeJs, then consider updating Moralis to v2, once it is published.\n\n",

These functionalities of the Streams API would normally require many thousands of node requests, but if you use Moralis, they are included for free. This will also save you a lot of development time as our solution is fully managed and will scale as your project grows.
