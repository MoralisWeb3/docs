We've added **HyperEVM mainnet** to the **Moralis Streams API**. You can now listen to real-time blockchain activity on HyperEVM - perfect for notifications, indexing, and on-chain automation.

## What you get
- 🔔 Real-time events: contract logs, native & token transfers, NFT mints/transfers, wallet activity  
- ⚡ Low-latency webhooks with retries & idempotency  
- 🧩 Works with your existing stream filters and ABIs  
- 📈 Scales with your traffic

## How to use
1. Create or update a Stream in your dashboard or via API.  
2. Select **HyperEVM (mainnet)** as a chain.  
3. Add your address filters/ABIs and save - webhooks start flowing instantly.

## Great for
- Alerting users on transfers or mints  
- Powering indexers/search for your dapp  
- Triggering off-chain workflows from on-chain events

If you're already streaming other chains, just add HyperEVM to that stream (or create a new one) and you're set. 🚀
