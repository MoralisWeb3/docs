We've just shipped a new EVM feature Get Multiple NFTs, meaning you can now specify a list of NFTs to return in one API call. :zap:

It was already possible to fetch all NFTs by wallet address or by collection address, but now it's possible to fetch specific NFTs across many different collections by specifying a list of collection IDs + token IDs. ðŸŽ‰
