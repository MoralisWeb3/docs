Today we have launched four new ERC20 token endpoints allowing you to quickly fetch mints, burns, approvals and transfers for any wallet or contract address 🚀

These endpoints have no required inputs or query parameters, meaning we return all on-chain transactions by default. Each endpoint supports flexible filtering by wallet address, contract address and even addresses to exclude (see more about filtering below).

<!--truncate-->

### 🆕 Mints

Fetch all token mints, including by wallet address or for a given contract using `/erc20/mints`.

Example use case: lookup and monitor all mint events for the USDC contract.

[Read the docs](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/get-erc20-mints)

### 🔥 Burns

Fetch all token burns, including by wallet address or for a given contract using `/erc20/burns`.

Example use case: lookup and monitor all burn events for the Wrapped Ether contract.

[Read the docs](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/get-erc20-burns)

### 👍 Approvals

Quickly identify all approvals that exist on one or many addresses. Never forget which protocols have access to your funds!

Example use case: build your own token approval checker, similar to [Etherscan's](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker).

### ↪️ Transfers

We already have endpoints for ERC20 transfers, however, this new endpoint `/erc20/transfers` is more flexible, scalable and boasts faster response times; and also has the added benefit of more granular filtering (see below).

Example use case: identify all ERC20 transfers from your own wallet, or from a specific contract such as Uniswap.

### Filtering

Each endpoint supports the following filtering:

- `contract_addresses`: One or many contract addresses to only include
- `exclude_contracts`: One or many contract addresses to exclude
- `wallet_addresses`: One or many wallet addresses to only include
- `exclude_wallets`: One or many wallet addresses to exclude
