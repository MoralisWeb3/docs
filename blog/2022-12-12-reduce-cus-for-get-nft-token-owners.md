More CUs for our amazing customers!

After considerations on the great demand of the getTokenIdOwners endpoint, we understand that a lot of our users are very keen to make full use of this endpoint.

Therefore, we have decided to reduce our CU cost for `/nft/{address}/{token_id}/owners` (getTokenIdOwners) from 20 CUs down to 5 CUs.

Try out the endpoint here!
