## Changelog: Raydium LaunchLab Support

### Release Date: April 30, 2025

We're excited to announce full support for Raydium's LaunchLab token launch platform on the Moralis Token API! This integration provides comprehensive data access for all tokens launched through Raydium's new token launchpad.

### What's New?

The Moralis Token API now fully supports Raydium's LaunchLab with comprehensive data access:

- **Token Price Data**: Get real-time and historical price information for any LaunchLab token
- **Pair Analytics**: Access detailed statistics on LaunchLab token trading pairs including liquidity and volume
- **Transaction Tracking**: Monitor all swap transactions involving LaunchLab tokens
- **OHLCV Data**: Access candlestick data for technical analysis of LaunchLab tokens
- **Multi-Token Queries**: Fetch data for multiple LaunchLab tokens in a single API call

All existing Token API endpoints now work seamlessly with LaunchLab tokens, allowing you to integrate complete LaunchLab data into your applications with minimal effort.

### Getting Started

Access LaunchLab token data through the standard Moralis Token API endpoints with the Raydium LaunchLab tokens.
