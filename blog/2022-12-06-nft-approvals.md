`nftApprovals` in webhooks becomes deprecated. A new list `nftTokenApprovals` is introduced. The new field will not split between `ERC1155` and `ERC721` instead it unifies the NFT Approvals.

```js
{
  ...,
  nftTokenApprovals: [
   {
     transactionHash: "0xf0c7542c73e2d26cc0b249da63426643263463463646345",
     logIndex: "0",
     contract: "0xf573d99385c05c23b24ed33de616ad16a43a0919",
     account: "0x6887246668a3b87f54deb3b94ba47a6f63f32985",
     operator: "0x34b6a28edbbaf0c7542c73e2d26cc0b249da69a6",
     approvedAll: false,
     tokenId: '1',
     tokenName: 'STREAMSNFT',
     tokenSymbol: 'StrNft',
     tokenContractType: 'ERC721',
    },
    {
      transactionHash: "0x60c7542c73e2d26cc0b249da63426643263463467846235",
      logIndex: '0',
      contract: '0xd119b250d83893860159f8a7b7a751bc044655a1',
      account: '0x6887246668a3b87f54deb3b94ba47a6f63f32985',
