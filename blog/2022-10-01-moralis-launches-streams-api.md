Stream blockchain data into your backend via webhooks. Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Fantom, Cronos and all testnets are supported. We’re working on adding more networks every day! 🚀🎉

Moralis’ Streams API is the latest addition to the Moralis API suite (which includes our popular NFT API, EVM API, Solana API and more). With this new API, you can get real-time on-chain events sent directly to your backend via webhooks! What does this mean? It means seamless access to:

- See every time a specified address receives, sends, swaps, stakes, or burns assets
- Track when battles or events start in your Web3 game or metaverse
- Monitor when an address joins your token sale
- That’s not all! In true Moralis style, the Streams API is fully configurable. Set custom filters to capture the exact on-chain event you need for your project as soon as they fire.

Moreover, each event comes enriched with important data, such as “tokenName”, “tokenSymbol”, “contractType” (for NFTs), “decimals” (for ERC-20 tokens), and more enriched data events will be added soon.
