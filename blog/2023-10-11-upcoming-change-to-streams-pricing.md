Up until now, Streams and API pricing has been separate. And all accounts on Moralis have had a certain number of Stream records included in their plan. 

Today we're announcing the streamlining of Streams and API pricing. Both Streams and API moving forward will be priced in Compute Units. 

Each Streams record will have a fixed price of 15 Compute Units. Which means that the amount of Streams records included in your plan will be a lot higher than today for the vast majority of clients.

The change will go live on October 16th. For all Streams user it will be a seamless transition without the need for any action on their side.

As an example, a Pro plan user who solely uses Streams would go from having 50,000 records included in their plan to have over 660,000 records included.

A business plan user who solely uses Streams would go from having 50,000 records included to have over 2.3 million records included.  

Any separately purchased Streams plan will be compensated with the same amount of Compute Units being added to their Moralis plan.

If you have any questions about this transition please contact our 24/7 support at hello@moralis.io.
