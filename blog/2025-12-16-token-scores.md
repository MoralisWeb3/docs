We've launched the **Moralis Token Score** - a unified **0–100 rating** that summarizes a token's onchain quality in a single, easy-to-use metric.

## What it is
The Token Score evaluates tokens using **six weighted onchain signals**:
- Token age & maturity  
- Liquidity depth  
- Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) reasonableness  
- Holder supply distribution  
- Trading volume  
- Transaction activity  

Higher scores indicate stronger onchain fundamentals, while lower scores highlight weaker liquidity, activity, distribution, or unrealistic valuations.

## Key details
- 📊 Simple to display, filter, and sort  
- 🔄 **Dynamic & real-time** - scores update automatically as onchain data changes  
- ⏳ Naturally decays if a token becomes inactive  
- ⚠️ New tokens may appear volatile initially as data accumulates
