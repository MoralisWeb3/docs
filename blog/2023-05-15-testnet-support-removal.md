Today we have removed support for **Cronos Testnet** and **Avalanche Testnet**. Cronos Mainnet and Avalanche Mainnet will remain.

<!-- truncate -->

For developers building on these testnets, we recommend building on an alternate EVM testnet that is supported (such as Goerli, Sepolia etc), or use one of the following options:

* [Avascan Testnet API](https://docs.avascan.info/)
* [Cronos Testnet API](https://testnet.cronoscan.com/apis)
