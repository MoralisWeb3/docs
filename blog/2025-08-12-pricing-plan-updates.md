## ðŸš€ New: Starter Plan

**Starter includes:**
- Everything in the **Free** plan

- **5 RPC nodes**

## ðŸ’ª Pro Plan Upgrades

We've made **Pro** more powerful and flexible:

- Increased CU/second from **1,500 â†’ 2,000**
- Increased RPC Nodes from **5 â†’ 20**
- **[Premium endpoints](https://docs.moralis.com/web3-data-api/evm/premium-endpoints)** now included (previously Business-only)
- **Optional Slack/Telegram group access** with our team

Everyone currently on the **Pro** plan has already received these increased limits - no action needed.
