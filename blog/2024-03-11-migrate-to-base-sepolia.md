On March 29th, 2024, we plan to deprecate Base Goerli testnet and therefore advise customers to switch over to **Base Sepolia** testnet as soon as possible. 

<!-- truncate -->

Following Base Goerli's deprecation on February 9th 2024, we will fully remove support for Base Goerli on March 29th. Customers that are currently still using Base Goerli for historical transaction data are strongly advised to migrate to Base Sepolia as soon as possible.

Base Sepolia chain details:
- API `chain` query parameter: `base sepolia` or `0x14a34`
- SDK chain identifier: `EvmChain.BASE_SEPOLIA`
