We've made **Streams more cost-efficient**!  

<!-- truncate -->

- ðŸ”„ Pricing has been reduced from **50 CUs per record â†’ 10 CUs per record**  
- ðŸ“‰ This means up to **5x more data** for the same cost  
- ðŸš€ Applies to all chains and all Streams starting today

No action needed on your end - your existing Streams are already benefiting from the new pricing.
