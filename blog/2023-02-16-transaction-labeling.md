Today we have launched version 1 of our new transaction decoding and labeling feature ðŸ¥³

This feature automatically decodes raw transaction input data into human-readable events and then labels each transaction and log, allowing you to quickly identify on-chain activity such as Transfer, Swap, Deposit etc.

Transaction labeling can be found on the following two endpoints:

- [Get decoded transactions by wallet](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/get-decoded-wallet-transaction)
- [Get decoded transaction by hash](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/get-decoded-transaction)

[Head over to our docs](https://docs.moralis.io/web3-data-api/transaction-labelling) for more information about how this works.
