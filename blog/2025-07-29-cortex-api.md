# New Launch: Moralis Cortex API: AI-Powered Web3 Intelligence

**Moralis Cortex** is now live - an AI-native API that gives you real-time, explainable insights from blockchain data.

<!-- truncate -->

Built on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, Cortex connects verified on-chain activity to LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude. Ask natural language questions, receive structured and grounded answers.

## Hosted Cortex API

A simple REST endpoint to access AI-powered blockchain intelligence - no setup required.


```
POST https://cortex-api.moralis.io/chat
```

## Self-Hosted MCP Server

Run Cortex in your own infrastructure for full control.

- Install via NPM
- Plug in your own LLM keys (OpenAI, Claude, OSS)
- Customize grounding logic, plugins, and data sources


Grounded in Moralis data. Built for production.
