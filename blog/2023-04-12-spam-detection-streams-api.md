We're excited to announce the launch of our new spam detection feature to EVM Streams API! 

Property called **`possibleSpam`** for the following items in the webhook: `erc20Transfers`, `erc20Approvals`, `nftTokenApprovals`, and `nftTransfers`. This property can be **`true`** or **`false`**,depending on whether the contract address is associated with spam, phishing attempts, or suspicious activities.

[Check out our docs](/web3-data-api/evm/nft-spam-detection) for more information about this feature including which endpoints it's active on.
