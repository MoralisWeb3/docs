We've added **Monad EVM** support to both the **Data APIs** and the **Streams API**, giving you access to this next-generation, EVM-compatible Layer-1 that delivers 10,000 TPS, 0.4-second block times, 800 ms finality, and near-zero gas fees. 🚀

### What you get
- Full **Data API** support for Monad Mainnet (`0x8f`)
- Real-time **Streams API** event tracking for Monad smart contracts
- Query wallet balances, transfers, NFTs, and full transaction history with ease
- Listen to onchain Monad events with Streams

### High Performance at Scale
Monad executes transactions in parallel, enabling 10,000+ TPS, 0.4-second block times, and sub-second finality. This is ideal for:
- DeFi and trading applications
- High-volume gaming dapps
- Consumer applications requiring instant confirmations

### Fully EVM Compatible
Monad is a native EVM Layer-1. Deploy existing Solidity contracts, frameworks, and tools directly - no rewrites, no extra steps - on Monad, utilizing its speed, cost efficiency, and reliability.
