Our DeFi endpoints now support Etherfi, Rocket Pool and Spark ðŸ”¥

{/* truncate */}

### Endpoints in Scope
These new protocols are live across the following endpoints:
- **[DeFi Protocols by Wallet](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/wallet-api/get-defi-summary?address=0xcB1C1FdE09f811B294172696404e88E658659905&chain=eth):** This endpoint provides a summary breakdown of all protocols that the wallet is currently interacting with, as well as summary wallet stats including the total USD value held in DeFi protocols, as well as the total unclaimed USD value available.
- **[DeFi Positions by Wallet](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/wallet-api/get-defi-positions-summary?address=0xcB1C1FdE09f811B294172696404e88E658659905&chain=eth):** This endpoint provides a summary breakdown of all protocol positions that the wallet is currently interacting with in a standardized format, with each position being an individual object.
- **[Get Detailed DeFi Positions by Wallet and Protocol](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/wallet-api/get-defi-positions-by-protocol?address=0xcB1C1FdE09f811B294172696404e88E658659905&protocol=uniswap-v3&chain=eth):** This endpoint provides a detailed breakdown of all positions for a given wallet and protocol, including protocol/position-specific data within position_details.
