Our NFT API now includes a new property called `verified_collections` ðŸŽ‰ This property can be `true` or `false`, and reflects whether or not the collection has been verified on OpenSea. This new property can be found on all NFT endpoints.

<!-- truncate -->

Additionally, we have added a new query parameter called `exclude_spam`. When this is set to `true`, any NFTs that have been marked as spam will be excluded from the API response. This query parameter is currently available on [get NFTs by wallet](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/wallet-api/get-nfts-by-wallet) as well as [get NFT collections by wallet](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/wallet-api/get-nft-collections-by-wallet).
