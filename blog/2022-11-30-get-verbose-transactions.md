One API - all transactions and logs. ✨ Use our Verbose Transaction Endpoint and save yourself the hassle of multiple API calls. What's more, this Transaction API endpoint extracts data sequenced by block number. Organized - just how you like it.

We have launched a new endpoint `/{address}/verbose` which for a given wallet `address` will return all transactions, and for each transaction all its logs.
