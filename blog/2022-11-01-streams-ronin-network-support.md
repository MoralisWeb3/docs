We’re excited to announce Moralis now supports the Ronin Network!

We’re thrilled to share that we’re now launching support for Ronin, the popular gaming sidechain set up by Axie Infinity creators Sky Mavis. Specifically, we’re especially happy to be bringing Roning support to our Streams API.

In fact, this is the first real-time events stream for Ronin Network – making it easier than ever for Ronin developers to work with real-time blockchain data!
