From today you can now easily establish a wallet's age as well as detect which chains it has been active on ðŸ”¥

<!-- truncate -->

This latest endpointadded to our Wallet API, `/wallets/{address}/chains`, is our first truly cross-chain API. Rather than the usual `chain` query parameter, it has a new `chains` parameter, allowing you to specify one or many chains in one API call ðŸ¤©

For each chain that a wallet has been detected on, we return its `first_transaction` details and `last_transaction` details. 

Perfect for wallet analytics, user engagement, wallet age gated sites plus so much more ðŸ™Œ
