Today we've launched a new endpoint that allows you and the users of your dapps to submit contracts for review. 

<!-- truncate -->

Easily report new spam contracts by specifying `report_type` as `spam`, or request a re-review of misclassified contracts with a `report_type` of `not_spam`.

Submissions will be reviewed and incorporated into our spam library, and reflected across our ERC20 and NFT API endpoints.
