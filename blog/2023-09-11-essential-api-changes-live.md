Starting today, **September 11th, 2023**, we're implementing a series of significant API changes to `v2` of our EVM API as [described in an earlier post](/changelog/essential-api-changes). Some of these changes are breaking changes, but will ultimately provide you with a faster, more reliable, and more consistent experience.

<!-- truncate -->

If you are on API `v2` and are impacted by [these changes](/changelog/essential-api-changes) you can find a comprehensive [migration guide here](/web3-data-api/breaking-changes/migration-guide).

For those who have transitioned to `v2.2`, rest assured that your operations remain unaffected by these updates.
