Today we're excited to announce that we have enriched our ERC20 Token metadata endpoints with two new metrics: Total Supply and Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) âœ¨

<!-- truncate -->

When fetching token metadata, you'll now be returned with the following:

- `total_supply`: Total tokens created minus any that have been burned
- `total_supply_formatted`: Total tokens created minus any that have been burned (decimal formatted)
- `fully_diluted_valuation`: Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV), this represents the token's `current_price` x `total_supply`

Here's an example for Pepe:
