Our ERC20 transfers, NFT transfers and transaction endpoints have just got an upgrade!

<!-- truncate -->

All endpoints that currently return a `to_address` and/or `from_address` will now include an additional `to_address_label` and `from_address_less` respectively ğŸ¤© 

These labels reflect publicly known addresses such as `Coinbase`, `Binance`, `Uniswap v3`, `1inch` etc; as well as specific addresses such as `Uniswap v2: Router 2` ğŸ”¥

Perfect for adding extra detail into your wallet applications and transaction analytics ğŸ™Œ
