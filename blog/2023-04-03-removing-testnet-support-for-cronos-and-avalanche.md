Starting on 15th May 2023 we will remove support for **Cronos Testnet** and **Avalanche Testnet**. Cronos Mainnet and Avalanche Mainnet will remain.

For developers building on these testnets, we recommend building on an alternate EVM testnet that is supported (such as Goerli, Sepolia etc), or use one of the following options:

* [Avascan Testnet API](https://docs.avascan.info/)
* [Cronos Testnet API](https://testnet.cronoscan.com/apis)
